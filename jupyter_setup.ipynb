    "- A virtual environment is a sandbox for you to install and play around with different python packages without doing any irreversable damage to your default system.\n",
    "- Once a new virtual environment (`venv`) is created, you can enter, exit and switch between different `venv` as you wish.\n",
    "- Code is constantly changing and to keep up there are versions of each package. Not all versions of code are compatable with each other, therefore it is recommended to use a package manager such as Annaconda.\n",
    "- It is good practice to create a new `venv` per project. When sharing your project, it is a good idea to also share the `venv` you have used. This way, any collaborator will be able to emulate your system and avoid errors due to version differences.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.2 Let's demonstrate this ourselves\n",
    "\n",
    "- We have created a `venv` containing all the relevant packages you will need throughout this course and exported the `venv` as the file `data_analytics.yml`.\n",
    "- __Note__: make sure that this workbook `jupyter_setup.ipynb` and the file `data_analytics.yml` are saved in the same location.\n",
    "- To create the `venv` for your own computer, run the cell below."
